I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, a faculty affiliate at the Vector Institute, a faculty affiliate at <a href="https://axl.vc/">AXL</a>, and a founding member of the [Toronto Computational Imaging Group](https://compimaging.dgp.toronto.edu/). 

My research focuses on *physically based intelligent sensing:* a paradigm that combines physically based models, signal processing, and artificial intelligence to break the limits of current sensing systems and re-think how we reconstruct the world from captured visual information. Along these lines I've worked on techniques to [image around corners](http://go.ted.com/davidlindell/){:target="_blank"} and through scattering media as well as machine learning algorithms to represent, reconstruct, and generate the appearance and geometry of 3D scenes. My work is relevant to a broad range of applications in computational imaging, computer graphics, computer vision, and remote sensing. 

<!-- Students interested in joining my group starting in fall 2025 should apply to the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/prospective). More on [this page](/joining).
